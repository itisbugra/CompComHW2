### Analyzing short-burst traffic

Assuming we have the IP address `192.168.1.16`, we could sniff TCP traffic on our network by using various *Wireshark* filters. 
We are going to make an HTTP request from our web browser to the website *ccsf.edu*. 
In order to inspect this operation in *Wireshark*, we could use following information to build our filtering expression.

1. Our IP address is 192.168.1.16. HTTP protocol uses TCP/IP sockets for sending the request and receiving the response. Hence, our IP address will be contained in both source and destination fields.

```
(ip.src == 192.168.1.16 or ip.dst == 192.168.1.16)
```

2. *HTTP* protocol uses port 80 as default, if port is not specified on browser, it will attempt to connect to the default port.
In our case, we didn't write any port field to the URL of the website, hence the port will be 80.

```
tcp.port == 80
```

Combining these two predicates, it results in the following predicate. 

```
(ip.src == 192.168.1.16 or ip.dst == 192.168.1.16) and tcp.port == 80
```

When we apply a display filter to the sniffed packets, the following table will be shown in *Wireshark*.

Notice that there are still TCP entries not related to our task.
We could filter the results by requesting only for the HTTP-related packets by adding following predicate to the filter.

```
http
```

Our new filtering predicate will be as follows.

```
(ip.src == 192.168.1.16 or ip.dst == 192.168.1.16) and tcp.port == 80 and http
```

The resulting packets are much more precise than our initial attempt.

Looking for the package with the number *82*, since we requested to the root path of the website, our destination address is `147.144.1.212`.
We could filter the remaining packets by adding the destination address as a predicate.

```
(ip.src == 147.144.1.212 or ip.dst == 147.144.1.212)
```

This adds to our predicate.

```
(ip.src == 192.168.1.16 or ip.dst == 192.168.1.16) and tcp.port == 80 and http and (ip.src == 147.144.1.212 or ip.dst == 147.144.1.212)
```

Removing the `http` predicate from our filters, we could reach all of the TCP traffic.

#### Round-trip time of the flow

The TCP round-trip time analysis between our client and the server can be derived from our last filtering.

#### Sequence & acknowledgement analysis

As it is shown in the table, HTTP response is sent in 6 TCP segments.
The sequence number starts from 1, and on each successful transmission, the acknowledge is sent with the same value of 462, and the next sequence number is added the length of the packet.
In packet with number 4, there is push flag, `PSH`, involved.
This is due to package is smaller than the common length negotiated during `SYN` of TCP bootstrapping.

During transmission, there was no error, hence no retransmission occurred.

### Analyzing long-burst traffic

Without changing our local IP `192.168.1.16`, we could sniff TCP traffic on our network while watching a video on [YouTube](https://youtube.com).
We open https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF8E4j1EVRY in a web browser and start sniffing.

By sorting the packets by total data size of the stream, we could understand that `173.194.2.141` is the source address of the video data transmitted through TCP.
We can filter the packets by applying following filter.

```
ip.src == 173.194.2.141
```

Our address is also destination, adding the next filter.

```
ip.dst == 192.168.1.16
```

We also want to filter the TCP packets.

```
tcp
```

We finally have the following predicate.

```
ip.src == 173.194.2.141 and ip.dst == 192.168.1.16 and tcp
```

Another thing we want is TCP retransmissions. Following predicate filters that.

```
tcp.analysis.retransmission
```

#### Sequence & acknowledgement analysis

Length of the packets are 1420 and constant during transmission.
Transmission of media data starts at 1421th sequence.

Using `ip.src == 173.194.2.141 and ip.dst == 192.168.1.16 and tcp.analysis.retransmission` we could derive retransmitted packages.
There was only one package retransmitted.
